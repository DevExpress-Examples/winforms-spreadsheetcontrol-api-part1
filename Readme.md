# WinForms Spreadsheet API â€“ How to Process Excel Workbooks in Code (Part 1)

The [WinForms Spreadsheet Control](https://www.devexpress.com/products/net/controls/winforms/spreadsheet/) allows you to create high-impact business data analysis solutions that emulate the look, feel and capabilities of Microsoft ExcelÂ®. It includes full integration with the DevExpress Ribbon control so you can deliver Excel inspired functionality with minimal effort.

This example demonstrates how to use the Spreadsheet API to execute the following actions:

* Manage spreadsheet document elements (worksheets, cells, rows, and columns)
* Create formulas
* Format cells
* Import data from different data sources
* Export a workbook to PDF
* Print a workbook

The application form contains the list of supported operations. A user can select an operation and click the **Run** button to view the resulting spreadsheet document in the Spreadsheet control.
